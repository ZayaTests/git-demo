Hello, is it me you're looking for?
Is it me, is it me, is it me
Is it me you're looking for?
Is it me, is it me

I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much, I love you
